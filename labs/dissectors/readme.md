# ðŸ§© Wireshark Custom Dissectors

This folder contains Lua-based Wireshark dissectors built for hands-on labs and hypothetical protocol decoding exercises.

- `myproto.lua`: A basic custom protocol dissector that demonstrates how to parse raw TCP payloads on port 12345.

Dissectors in this repo are written for learning and exploration â€” no production protocols or sensitive traffic is decoded.
